# CloudyPy
Nebular modeling using the Cloudy software and PyCloudy package

This repository contains code used to model the Orion Nebula (M42, NGC 1976) with Cloudy, using the PyCloudy package in Python. In order to run this, you must have Cloudy built and installed on your machine. Note that PyCloudy is not well-documented, so I will try to provide as many resources as possible. 

Spectra were taken using a SBIG SGS spectrometer at Gustavus Adophus College. They are fomatted as .ST7 files. Included are two spectra of the gaseous region of M42, one of the nebula including the central stars, additional spectra of a few bright stars such as Betelgeuse and Sirius for whatever reason you might need them (I took these when learning to use the spectrometer), as well as a sky reference spectrum and mercury lamp reference spectrum.
